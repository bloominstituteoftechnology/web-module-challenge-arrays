## Objectives

- use arrays to store and access data
- use array properties and array methods

## Introduction

Baskin Robins, a global chain of ice cream parlors, first opened in 1945 and served 31 flavors of Ice Cream. They have grown to almost 6,000 franchises world wide and have now became famous for serving exactly 31 flavors at a time. Since they first opened, they no longer serve the same 31 flavors, but they do always have exactly 31 ice cream flavors available.

Your challenge today will be to work with their array of ice cream flavors to access, remove, and add flavors, all while ensuring the length never exceeds 31.

## Instructions

### Task 1: Set up Project

Using VSCode and Command Line:


1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your forked version of the repo
3. cd into your repo and create a branch with your first and last name
4. open the terminal in your vs code and type `npm install`
5. next type `npm run test` in your terminal
6. Complete your work making regular commits, once you have all your tests passing and you are ready to submit your work please see canvas for instructions on how to submit

### Task 2: MVP

Find the file `index.js` and complete the tasks until your returns look like the expected returns. Do not use any of the forbidden methods! Forbidden methods are `.forEach()`, `.map()`, `.filter()` and `.reduce()`

### Testing & Debugging

Open a second terminal inside of your project by clicking on the split terminal icon
![alt text](assets/split_terminal.png "Split Terminal")

Inside of your second terminal type `npm start` 
![alt text](assets/npm_start.png "type npm start")

You will be running your tests in one terminal and debugging in the other. As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

### Task 3: Stretch

There are several stretch goals inside `index.js`. You may work on these once you have finished MVP requirements for the day!

## FAQs

**Why aren't my results showing up in the console?**

Make sure you are invoking your function after defining and wrapping a console.log around the invocation in order to view results in the console.
